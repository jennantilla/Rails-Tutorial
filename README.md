# README

This was my first experimentation with the rails framework. I followed the step-by-step guide found at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Key things I learned:

* The functions of controllers and views

* How generators make life easier

* CRUD operations and how they impact resources 

* Data migrations
